# Dashboard catalog

Canonical dashboard IDs, friendly-name aliases, and resolution rules. Extracted verbatim
from `python/cid_mcp_external/catalog.py` (`DASHBOARDS` and `DASHBOARD_ALIASES`). The Python
source is authoritative; if README prose disagrees, the source wins.

Use this file to:

- turn a user's phrase ("CUDOS", "trusted advisor", "cost anomalies") into the canonical
  `--dashboard-id` value `cid-cmd` expects, and
- decide whether a dashboard needs the advanced Data Collection pipeline before it will show
  data.

## Resolution rule

`cid-cmd deploy/update/delete/status` take `--dashboard-id <canonical-id>`. To resolve a
user phrase to a canonical id:

1. Normalize: trim, lowercase, and collapse internal whitespace to single spaces.
2. If the normalized string matches an alias key in the alias table, use its canonical id.
3. Otherwise, if it matches a canonical id, use that.
4. Otherwise, pass the user's value through unchanged and let `cid-cmd` return the
   authoritative "unknown dashboard-id" error. This catalog is a convenience layer, not a
   gate.

Note the one deliberate collision: the friendly name `cudos` resolves to `cudos-v5` (the
current version), while the exact canonical id `cudos` is the deprecated v4. A user who
truly wants v4 must ask for the exact id `cudos`.

"Needs Data Collection = yes" means the dashboard's data comes from the advanced Data
Collection pipeline (`deploy-data-collection.yaml`) rather than CUR alone. Deploy the Data
Collection stack and let it run at least once before expecting data. See
[data-collection-modules.md](./data-collection-modules.md).
